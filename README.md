## Report should have:

### Notes:
- covid insight in 2020 to be mentioned.

### Canvas Notes:
- Motivation. Motivate and outline the goals and questions you address. Why is this work important, what are the challenges, will benefits from the results. In short, what problem are you trying to solve?
- Data Collection & Data Understanding. If your project requires the collection of data, discuss why this data is suitable for your task; technical details may include how you collected the data. You should show a good understanding of your data, i.e., appreciate the characteristics of the data (e.g., language/vocabulary, writing style, etc.)
- Data Preprocessing & Preparation. Motivate and justify which preprocessing steps you might have performed to transform the raw text dataset into a valid for the subsequent text mining techniques.
- Text Mining Methods. Describe how you chose and applied appropriate text mining techniques (e.g., clustering, classification, information extraction) to solve your task, or at least brought you closer to solve your task. This description should include the choice of important parameters. Note that you do not need to explain the techniques themselves. However, in case of more advanced methods or models, you should add relevant references. As a rule of thumb: Everything covered in the lectures does not need to be cited.
- Evaluation & Interpretation. Evaluate the performance of your approach, where performance mainly refers to effectiveness and less on efficiency. If your project allows for the consideration of different models (e.g., different types of classifiers) compare the performance of different methods. Discuss/interpret your results, and understand in what cases your methods perform bad, and discuss principle limitations and potential future steps for improvement.
